Title: Whoa!
Please don't listen to the bad reviews and watch this yourself.

I registered with IMDb just to write this. That is how much faith I have in this film. I really cannot believe some of these bad reviews.. "Not a kids film"?? kids would go mental for this.

Animation was nothing short of exquisite

Comedy was extremely funny (and i'm not one for comedies)

Story line was really great too

Also made me cry a little... meh

please please please watch how awesome this is. i'm nearly 28 and I absolutely loved it.

Title: Disney old magic
Inspired by Frozen I started my search for new Disney movie which will offer me same "Disney magic" as i experienced in Lion King, Pocahontas, Bugs life, Frozen etc.

So I found Big hero 6, and the magic started. This movie is made for all ages. What i find very interesting in this new Disney movie is that he is very educational, specially for children, but grown ups will enjoy ether. characterization is very deep , and you will feel as you are one of the characters in this beautiful story. Visual effects are stunning, so u will experience another Disney master piece.

After seeing this movie , I would really recommend it to all movie lovers, especially fans of the Disney cartoon movies. If you are looking for an intelligent and inspiring cartoon movie for your youngest, you can stop looking because you just found it.

Title: Disney Going Hero
Big Hero 6 is another in a line of many successful Disney animated movies. And rightly so, might I add. The movie is about a boy, Hiro, his friends, Nerds and a health care prototype robot, Baymax. They live in a not so distant, technologically advanced future in a city called San Fransokyo. The story is action-packed comedy with dramatic elements to it and, as such, is appropriate for all ages. If you love Marvel movies, you will most definitely like this one as well. If you are more akin to beautiful landscapes and animated design, then by all means, this is the movie you will want to watch. If you are feeling down, the abundance of comedy, present in this movie is sure to make your day up. There is also a lot to learn from this movie, as some of the most important things (as well as most painful) in our lives, are depicted in this movie. Plus, the movie features one quite notorious figure (without too many spoilers). In short, the movie is a must see for children and for grown-ups as well, if they have a child lurking somewhere within them. Do not make a mistake and pass on a beauty of this movie.

Title: If you love Disney and Marvel movies, Big Hero 6 is definitely for you!
I went to watch this movie with my son aged 10 and daughter aged 7 - it was my son who was especially keen to see this, and to be honest, I wasn't really expecting much, as I hadn't watched any trailers about it, or heard much about it, & I thought it maybe more a boys' movie and my son would enjoy it more than my daughter or myself...

However... For the entire movie, myself and both of my children were completely immersed in it, and it evoked a range of thoughts, feelings and emotions in all of us, which included laughter and reducing us to tears (and I don't usually cry easily!). We all came out from the cinema each wanting our very own Baymax, and we were talking about and reliving moments from the movie for weeks after! My son who is a huge Marvel fan too spotted and enjoyed that he could make connections with Big Hero 6 to its Marvel origins.

Mine and my children's conclusion... We loved this pretty much the same as we loved Frozen... Another fantastic animated movie from Disney!

Title: With the Action of Marvel, Emotions of Disney, and Comedy of Both, Big Hero 6 is a fantastic film for anyone.
Back in 2009, Disney purchased Marvel Comics for four billion dollars. Shocking and surprising the world, many fans of both sides were curious whether Disney would make an animation film based on a group of characters from the comics. Three years later, Director Don Hall approached John Lasseter on making a film with Marvel Characters and found the Big Hero 6, a comic book series that even the most well known of comics didn't know who they were. In fact they were so obscure that Marvel themselves even forgot that they had the characters.

Marvel gave Disney the liberty to change the characters so that they could be seen as a Disney Animation Film. And the result is simply refreshing.

Big Hero 6 is a beautiful film, showcasing how much animation has become. The east and west coast mash up of San Fransokyo combines to make such a spectacular scenery, that the city may as well be a character to the film.

The cast is also fun to watch. One annoyance films try to do is by shoving the diversity of characters in your face. Big Hero 6 doesn't do that, instead the focus is on the characters themselves and not the diversity, making it enjoyable to watch. One of the biggest highlights is the girls of the cast. I took my 3 nieces with my friends and I, and they loved how they were smart, enjoyable and didn't need to fall for a man. The cast is truly relatable, whether you are precise like Wasabi, positive like Honey Lemon or just a guy who loves media like Fred.

Of course the star of the film is the robot of Baymax. Any scene that he is in steals the show, whether it is his introduction or his care for Hiro and Company.

The Villain by far is one of the best villains in recent Disney history, he doesn't sing, dance or monologue, he simply gets the job done.

The film showcases the action greatly by giving large scopes and music that fits exceptionally well. Emotionally, the film captures the audience by showcasing the bond of brotherhood between Hiro and his older brother Tadashi, as well as his friend Baymax who is like a Surrogate brother to our main hero.

A strong lesson in this film, is that family can be more than blood related, you have friends, who become part of that. That really showed how much I cared for the loved ones around me, especially my older brother who is in the military, creating robots and fixing medical equipment.

If there was one complaint I would give, I would've like to see a little bit more about the rest of the team. Other than that, Big Hero 6 is a heartwarming tale that captures something for the entire family.

Big Hero 6 is another showing that Disney can continue to make great films after the juggernaut that was Frozen. This film showcases that the Disney Revival (Films such as The Princess and the Frog, Tangled, Wreck-it-Ralph and Frozen) is not over yet, and I cannot wait to see what the next film has to offer.

Title: Almost perfect....
Hiro is a teen genius who seems to waste his time until his brother sets him on a right track. Tragedy strikes, and Hiro teams up with new friends to find the truth...eventually saving the day.

Baymax is a robotic healthcare assistant that could have been developed as the usual annoying sidekick that has the heart of gold, but he just has a heart of gold here--as in doing research, his only intention is to help whomever he can.

On a scale from 1 to 10, I rate this movie a 9 because its heart and soul outweigh the problems I have with it. Some scenes might be upsetting to younger viewers, but it is perfect for all ages.

My issues:

1. One of the characters sounds stereotypical. 2. The villain's identity and motive feel tacked on.

I know the primary audience is not going to notice things like this, but I do...and I this happens to be one of those times that I cannot let it go.

Title: Why is this getting so much hate?
To be honest, when I saw the preview I thought it was going to be another Disney movie gone bad. So when the movies came around, I had really low expectations for it. But holy crap nothing has made me laugh this hard at a movie since maybe Amelie or Up! Baymax is a non-threatening huggable robot who's only purpose is to nurse those who are in need of medical attention. The only way to wake him up is to scream out "OW" and he is alive and will help you until you are better. The only way to put him back to sleep is to say "I'm satisfied with your work" (Or something like that I'm only paraphrasing) and he has gone back to sleep. But this movie isn't all comedy: it does have a bit of an emotional side to it which I won't go into too much detail about. However I do know that the movie isn't really like the comic books: the back stories of the characters aren't how they are in the movie and even the plot itself isn't like how the movie is, so for the devoted comic book fans, I understand if you hate this movie. However the people who didn't read the comics confuse me when they say it's "Cliche" "awful" "boring". I found none of these things in the movie at all. I was smiling right from the beginning and found myself a little teary-eyed towards the end.

So I do recommend this movie if you're up for a nice light movie with a lot of laughs: it might be better than you think.

Title: Awesome
My family got tickets to an early showing. The movie was excellent. The atmosphere was refreshingly different, the characters fleshed out, the plot touching, and the humor was rich and consistent . I would recommend this one to anyone, and especially to couples and families with children.Big Hero 6 really blew me away, I expected it to be good since Disney is having another animation renaissance but once the credits began to roll all I could do was wish it was longer. This movie has something for everyone, comedy, action, some despair. In fact, surprisingly the only thing missing was romance, which is fine with me. If you love superheroes, robots, and animated films, I think you've found your holy grail.

Title: Beautifully animated and fun filled family adventure
Disney has brought many gifts and rarely disappoints me. Big Hero 6 is one of the best Disney films I have seen since last year's Frozen. This film is fun, clever, imaginative, and filled with spectacle. While the film is somewhat similar to Pixar's The Incredibules due the film's plot dealing with robots and and children with superpowers, it is very enjoyable and would easy please children as well as parents.

Big Hero 6 is not only brings out the charm with heart-filling characters and comic relief but has some of the most dazzling CGI I have seen in a Disney movie. The animators did a fantastic job on the character models and the environment was nice looking. My favorite character would probably be Baymax. What's not to like about a funny, inflatable robot who cracks funny one-liners,has the power to heal, and assists Hiro (main character) on his quest to defeat an evil scientist?

I can't tell you how much I enjoyed this movie. I recommend this movie to all parents and children. Big Hero is a family thrill ride!!!

Title: A cool story with great animation and voice acting.
Honestly, I put off watching this because I didn't feel like I would enjoy it so much. I was proved wrong. Right from the start, the fresh animation of this film along with the brilliant editing and voice acting had me engaged. Though the plot is pretty flat and for kids, the concept is pretty new (in that it hasn't been totally overdone), dealing in robotics which allowed them to show some cool stuff. But the story being from Disney, did have moments of it being 'too easy' as well as a few stock characters but it wasn't such a big deal. The story was told well, and wasn't cheesy or boring at all. The freshness of the voices and the animation really put this film together.

The connection between the voices and animation really showed on screen the chemistry between the characters, and this worked to gain the sympathy of the viewer's at certain scenes. I thought that was well done, the characters were developed well in relation to each other. And I know I keep saying this, but I just really like the animation, and the effects. Baymax is so cute, and the other character's have a kind of Asian feel to them. It's also quite cool how the animated characters almost always resemble the actors voicing them (I guess this is intentional).

However, watching the trailer again, I notice that they miss some of the scenes out. I mean if you put it in the trailer, you've got to put it in the film! I would've liked to have seen the scene with Baymax and the soccer ball.

Title: Everyone needs a little Baymax in their lives
Big Hero 6 [2014] is the Disney 3-D animated comedy action film that centers on Hiro Hamada, a 14-year old robotics prodigy, Baymax (an inflatable health companion robot) and an unlikely team of superheros.

5/5 graphics. Big Hero 6 transports viewers into a new visual realm and relatively individual style (besides its anime resemblance). The story is set in the futuristic city of 'San Fransokyo'. A little of Tokyo and San Francisco in one place. This explains the amalgamation of both Japanese and American components within the story and setting. It should be noted that Big Hero 6 is not a wholly original idea, and the animation is inspired by the Marvel comic by the very same name.

Baymax. Voiced by Scott Adsit, this lovable robot is animated to appear soft, cuddly and adorable, credit goes to the graphics and writing team on this one. Hiro's close friendship with Baymax is a highlight. Baymax can hold his own on the screen alone too, just strolling through the city streets, caring for others health and well-being. So yeah, he's cute and he knows it.

Expect to have a couple of teary moments. I won't describe or skim through details, out of utmost respect for those who haven't had a chance to see it yet. Since more serious topics aren't the usual in children targeted animation films, it's a nice change of pace.

Fantastic message for the young'uns. The main character Hiro (voiced by Ryan Potter) and the rest of the superheros team study robotics at the local university (including T.J. Miller from Silicon Valley and Damon Wayans Jr from New Girl). Reach your potential, practice non-violence and exercise sacrifice. That's just the tip of the iceberg. There are more spoiler-worthy ones that will be omitted from this review entirely. By the way, it's not 'preachy' in the slightest.

Title: 5-word review: Dazzling, witty, emotional, enjoyably action-packed,
Thankfully not the sixth film in a sextuplet, Big Hero 6 is the latest visually dazzling Disney film since the studio's resurgence. I was not a fan of Frozen, deeming it inferior to Pixar's elite animation masterpieces, and the feature- length music video to 'Let it Go' was mildly enjoyable at best. However, Big Hero 6 is much more fun, with science prodigy Hiro Hamada (voiced by Ryan Potter) forming a bond with his brother's home-made "huggable" robot invention Baymax (voiced by Scott Adsit) and subsequently creating a team of superheroes to combat a masked villain with a nefarious motive (it's way better than I just made it sound.)

The best part about Big Hero 6 is undoubtedly one of 2014's cutest characters. An ever so slightly more health conscious Groot, Baymax, your personal health care companion, is the film's highlight. He and Hiro provide both a surprising amount of emotional depth and superb action sequences which most definitely reflect the story's connection with Marvel. The supreme quality of the animation makes the action and flying scenes through the excellently-designed 'San Fransokyo' city skyline visibly awesome, cueing an unfortunately audible Neo-worthy "Woah" from me several times. The soundtrack is also highly recommended.

Big Hero 6 isn't without its faults though. By all means don't lose faith if you need to see it with an offspring or younger sibling; it's certainly an enjoyable time. But it is not as re-watchable or fantastic as a Pixar offering or Disney Renaissance film. This is mainly due to the poorly fleshed out characters, with the exception of the two leads - the supporting characters who form the superhero team are decently done but disappear for a while before being re-introduced. Maybe I've become spoiled by Pixar over the last few years and am expecting too much from a kid's film. Probably. But make sure to see it anyway, and treat it like a Marvel film (which really it is) by watching out for the Stan Lee cameo and staying for the post-credits scene.

Title: Very entertaining and overall well-made
Honestly, I didn't have very high expectations for 'Big Hero 6', considering that I'm usually not a fan of Marvel's works, but I was gladly proved wrong.

Story wise, 'Big Hero 6' is rather formulaic and not too outstanding, but it's still very entertaining due to the way it balances all aspects. You have everything: drama that's not over the top but still touching, thrilling action, great comedy, and some okay twists. And more importantly, they all mix together perfectly, so you'll never get bored or frustrated, and at the same time, you will feel connected with the characters as they deal with some mature conflicts rarely seen in recent Disney products. A huge part of this accomplishment is thanks to the character Baymax. The guy is amazingly likable, steals every scene he's in, and has great contributions to every part of the movie. When the movie needs drama, he provides the sensitivity and cuteness, when it needs action, he's the coolest, and when it needs comedy, he's the funniest. His voice acting by Scott Adsit is also great as he sounds both emotional and cute, despite the robotic voice effects.

The rest of the characters, however, are hit and miss. Hiro is cool, and I like the way he deals with grief: quite mature and not excessive, though his voice doesn't sound like a 14-year-old. The other two boys in the group are okay because they tend to break away from stereotypes. But the others, including the main villains, are just cliché and forgettable.

Visually, 'Big Hero 6' is very stunning, mainly due to the lively San Fransokyo and the impressive effects. Personally, I find some of the action scenes in this to be the most cinematic and thrilling I've ever seen in animation. All of the camera movements, slow-motions, and lighting and explosion effects easily rival the best live-action blockbusters out there. Moreover, the characters' visual designs are also more imaginative than other recent Disney products'. This is especially true for Baymax, who is surprisingly expressive despite the minimalistic looks.

'Big Hero 6' is no masterpiece, and it may not be up to the standards of Pixar's classics or Dreamworks' 'How to Train Your Dragon', but nonetheless, it's still a greatly entertaining and well-made movie. I also love that it still leaves a lot open for the sequels as I now really look forward to them.

Title: Disney continues to impress with Big Hero 6
Big Hero 6 is not among the best that Disney has ever done and it isn't flawless. But it is still very good and one of their best easily since the Renaissance. It did feel a little rushed at times and felt like it tried to do a little too much in the storytelling, as a result some ideas that were introduced like the science-is-good message gets lost. If it slowed down and explored a little less areas it would have improved things. The villain felt underdeveloped and his reveal came over as very obvious and forced as well.

However, the animation is outstanding with lots of rich colours and textures, backgrounds that are incredibly detailed and sweet(but not in a cloying way) character designs. One of the best-looking recent Disney films definitely. The catchy and upbeat yet atmospheric and emotion-filled soundtrack and smart script are other things to like, as are the brisk(when not rushed) pacing and rousing if not exactly inventive action. While the story is not flawless, on the most part it's still a winner. Whatever originality it may lack, it more than compensates for that with fun and heart. There are plenty of funny moments(i.e. Stan Lee), and of the laugh-out-loud witty kind and even better is the emotional impact Big Hero 6 has. The brother-brother relationship is handled very affectingly, like between Anna and Elsa in Frozen it was Disney trying to explore a different kind of relationship than they did before and it succeeds in that respect.

Sure Big Hero 6 sometimes takes a dark tone but not in a heavy or inappropriate way, there's no reason why anybody should be disturbed by that. The characters are not the most developed ones there ever were and as said more should have been done with the villain, but they're still engaging. Hiro is a very flawed but still likable main protagonist and his relationship between brother Tadashi is beautifully done. The most memorable character for me though was Baymax, he has to be one of Disney's most adorable characters, along with Maximus(Tangled) and Sven(Frozen) he has one of their cutest since the Renaissance. As well as being beautifully designed he displays a lot of laughs and a wide range of emotions, literally the film's heart and soul. The voice work from all(I just wish that James Cromwell had more to do) is very good, with particular mention going to Scott Adsit and his voice is a good match with Ryan Potter's deeply felt Hiro. All in all, not one of Disney's best but one of their better ones of the past 15 years. Haven't seen all the Best Animated Feature nominees but while this viewer did prefer How to Train Your Dragon 2 and the un-nominated Lego Movie they still felt that Big Hero 6 was still a good enough film to merit an Oscar nomination. 8/10 Bethany Cox

Title: a GREAT film. one of the best
so i originally didn't care for this film. a waster of time, irrelevant to both Disney and marvels big plans. i assumed it would end up like daredevil or black cauldron, best forgotten, bow was i wrong. this film combines the amazing animation, writing and greatness of recent Disney like frozen and tangled, with the great plots of marvel. it nearly had me in tears at times, because there is so much emotion in this film, and had me laughing uncontrollably at others. the group is full of personalities that are lovable and great. baymax is the true highlight of the film, but hiro and tadashi are incredibly stong and great characters. wasabi is always there for the comic relief and gogo is bad-ass. but they all become great as serious characters. and you have to love how honey lemon says "hiro" obviously, there are some issues. no film is without sin. it is predictable, cliché and some of fred's lies are just too stupid for words. but they aren't the points that you will remember. this film is definitely worth a watch and i suggest to to EVERYONE

Title: Another Great from John Lasseter
3 February 2015 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Big Hero 6. With an Executive Producer like John Lasseter, whose name can be found on most of the well known animated films from, Toy Story, and Cars to the mighty success that is Frozen, you just know this is going to be another great. Great it was. These days it seems if you can find a good story you can make an amazing animation. Set in the futuristic yet oddly homely city of San Frantokyo, this is the story of Hiro, a brilliant 14 year old who is devastated after the death of his brother. Together with Baymax a health robot created by his brother, Hiro discovers dark deeds afoot and he uses his exceptional mind and some good friends to help save the day. The modern animation never ceases to amaze me how it can stir as much emotion as an live action feature. Take the opening 15 minutes of Up for example, if that doesn't make you reach for a hanky then there is no heart in you. This film is the same, you feel sorrow and it makes you laugh. I was advised to sit through the credits until the very end to see an extra, and in doing so I learned a flew things.....the amount of people needed to produce an animation is just as many as a live film, there is even an animator in charge of crowd scenes, and the sound was managed by Skywalker Sound out of Marin County California. Oh and the extra I was telling you about......let's just say......roll on the sequel.
