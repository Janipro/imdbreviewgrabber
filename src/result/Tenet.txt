Title: Necessary to watch twice, preferably with subtitles.
Its somewhat ironic that a movie about time travel can't be reviewed properly until your future self rewatches the movie.

It's bold of Nolan to make such a thoroughly dense blockbuster. He assumes people will actually want to see Tenet more than once so they can understand it properly, which some may not. This movie makes the chronology of Inception look as simplistic as tic-tac-toe.

Ergo, it's hard for me to give an accurate rating, without having seen it twice, as I'm still trying to figure out whether everything does indeed make sense. If it does, this movie is easily a 9 or 10. If it doesn't, it's a 6.

It's further not helped by the fact that the dialogue in the first 15 minutes of the movie is painfully hard to understand / hear. Either they were behind masks; they were practically mumbling; the sound effects were too loud; or all of the above. The exposition scenes are also waayyy too brief for something this complex -- a problem also shared with Interstellar actually.

(Interstellar had this minimalist exposition problem explaining Blight, where if you weren't careful, you'd miss this one sentence / scene in the entire movie explaining that Blight was a viral bacteria:

"Earth's atmosphere is 80% nitrogen, we don't even breathe nitrogen. Blight does, and as it thrives, our air gets less and less oxygen").

I guess it's a Nolan quirk. Hopefully, a revision of the film audio sorts the sound mixing out. I do like the soundtrack, but it's too loud initially.

I liked all the actors. You think John Washington can't act at first, but he can, and he grows on you as the film progresses. And Pattinson is his usual charming self. Elizabeth is a surprise treat. And so on.

Its worth a watch either way. See it with subtitles if you can. And definitely don't expect to fully understand whats going on the first time around.

Title: Disappointing at first watch, Masterpiece at second. Just a little bit loud
Its one hell of a complicated film. It will be very hard for an average viewer to gather all the information provided by this movie at the first watch. But the more you watch it, more hidden elements will come to light. And when you are able to put these hidden elements together. You will realize that this movie is just a "masterpiece" which takes the legacy of Christopher Nolan Forward

If I talk about acting, Then I have to say that Robert Pattinson has really proved himself as a very good actor in these recent years. And I am sure his acting skills will increase with time. His performance is charming and very smooth. Whenever he is on the camera, he steals the focus John David Washington is also fantastic in this movie. His performance is electrifying, I hope to see more from him in the future. Other characters such as Kenneth Branagh, Elizabeth, Himesh Patel, Dimple Kapadia, Clémence Poésy have also done quite well. And I dont think there is a need to talk about Michael Caine

Talking about Music, its awesome. I dont think you will miss Hans Zimmer's score. Ludwig has done a sufficient job. There is no lack of good score in the movie

Gotta love the editing and post production which has been put into this movie. I think its fair to say this Nolan film has focused more in its post production. The main problem in the movie is the sound mixing. Plot is already complex and some dialogues are very soft due to the high music score. It makes it harder to realize what is going on in the movie. Other Nolan movies had loud BGM too. But Audio and dialogues weren't a problem

My humble request to everyone is to please let the movie sink in your thoughts. Let your mind grasp all the elements of this movie. I am sure more people will find it better. Even those who think they got the plot. I can bet they are wrong.

Title: I think I'm dumb
Well, I've always known I was a little slow to the party but this movie was hard to follow! It might have been the cinema sound mix but my wife and I kept asking each other what they were saying.. the script was hard to hear let alone understand in its abstract form.. we got the gist of the concept but was still hard to piece everything together in the end! I think it's a movie that requires a few watches to wrap ya head round it, but then again i am a little slow.. lol

Title: Spectacular. But only Nolan and Schrödinger's cat knows what's going on.
Tenet is the long awaited new movie from Christopher Nolan. The movie that's set to reboot the multiplexes post-Covid. It's a manic, extremely loud, extremely baffling sci-fi cum spy rollercoaster that will please a lot of Nolan fan-boys but which left me with very mixed views.

John David Washington (Denzel's lad) plays "The Protagonist" - a crack-CIA field operative who is an unstoppable one-man army in the style of Hobbs or Shaw. Recruited into an even more shadowy organisation, he's on the trail of an international arms dealer, Andrei Sator (Kenneth Branagh in full villain mode). Sator is bullying his estranged wife Kat (Elizabeth Debicki) over custody of their son (and the film unusually has a BBFC warning about "Domestic Abuse"). Our hero jets the world to try to prevent a very particular kind of Armageddon while also keeping the vulnerable and attractive Kat alive.

This is cinema at its biggest and boldest. Nolan has taken a cinema 'splurge' gun, filled it with money, set it on rapid fire, removed the safety and let rip at the screen. Given that Nolan is famous for doing all of his 'effects' for real and 'in camera', some of what you see performed is almost unbelievable. You thought crashing a train through rush-hour traffic in "Inception" was crazy? You ain't seen nothing yet with the airport scene! And for lovers of Chinooks (I must admit I am one and rush out of the house to see one if I hear it coming!) there is positively Chinook-p*rn on offer in the film's ridiculously huge finale.

The 'inversion' aspects of the story also lends itself to some fight scenes - one in particular in an airport 'freeport' - which are both bizarre to watch and, I imagine, technically extremely challenging to pull off. In this regard John David Washington is an acrobatic and talented stunt performer in his own right, and must have trained for months for this role.

Nolan's crew also certainly racked up their air miles pre-lockdown, since the locations range far and wide across the world. The locations encompassed Denmark, Estonia, India, Italy, Norway, the United Kingdom, and United States. Hoyte Van Hoytema's cinematography is lush in introducing these, especially the beautiful Italian coast scenes. Although I did miss the David Arnold strings that would typically introduce these in a Bond movie: it felt like that was missing.

The 'timey-wimey' aspects of the plot are also intriguing and very cleverly done. There are numerous points at which you think "Oh, that's a sloppy continuity error" or "Shame the production design team missed that cracked wing mirror". Then later in the movie, you get at least a dozen "Aha!" moments. Some of them (no spoilers) are jaw-droppingly spectacular.

Perhaps the best twist is hidden in the final line of the movie. I only processed it on the way home.

And so to the first of my significant gripes with Tenet. The sound mix in the movie is all over the place. I'd go stronger than that... it's truly awful (expletive deleted)! Nolan often implements Shakespeare's trick of having characters in the play provide exposition of the plot to aid comprehension. But unfortunately, all of this exposition dialogue was largely incomprehensible. This was due to:

the ear-splitting volume of the sound: 2020 movie audiences are going to be suffering from 'Tenetis'! (LOL);
the dialogue is poorly mixed with the thumping music by Ludwig Göransson (Wot? No Hans Zimmer?);
a large proportion of the dialogue was through masks of varying description (#covid-appropriate). Aaron Taylor-Johnson was particularly unintelligible to my ears.


Overall, watching this with subtitles at a special showing might be advisable!

OK, so I only have a PhD in Physics... but at times I was completely lost as to the intricacies of the plot. It made "Inception" look like "The Tiger Who Came to Tea". There was an obvious 'McGuffin' in "Inception" - - ("These 'dream levels'... how exactly are they architected??".... "Don't worry... they'll never notice". And we didn't!) In "Tenet" there are McGuffins nested in McGuffins. So much of this is casually waved away as "future stuff... you're not qualified" that it feels vaguely condescending to the audience. At one point Sator says to Kat "You don't know what's going on, do you?" and she shakes her head blankly. We're right with you there luv!

There are also gaps in the storyline that jar. The word "Tenet"? What does it mean. Is it just a password? I'm none the wiser.

The manic pace of Tenet and the constant din means that the movie gallops along like a series of disconnected (albeit brilliant) action set pieces. For me, it has none of the emotional heart of the Cobb's marriage problems from "Inception" or the father/daughter separation of "Interstellar". In fact, you barely care for anyone in the movie, perhaps with the exception of Kat.

It's a talented cast. As mentioned above, John David Washington is muscular and athletic in the role. It's a big load for the actor to carry in such a tent-pole movie, given his only significant starring role before was in the excellent BlacKkKlansman. But he carries it off well. A worthy successor to Gerard Butler and Jason Statham for action roles in the next 10 years.

This is also a great performance by Robert Pattinson, in his most high-profile film in a long time, playing the vaguely alcoholic and Carré-esque support guy. Pattinson's Potter co-star Clemence Poésy also pops up - rather more un-glam that usual - as the scientist plot-expositor early in the movie.

Nolan's regular Michael Caine also pops up. although the 87-year old legend is starting to show his age: His speech was obviously affected at the time of filming (though nice try Mr Nolan in trying to disguise that with a mouth full of food!). But in my book, any amount of Caine in a movie is a plus. He also gets to deliver the best killer line in the film about snobbery!

However, it's Kenneth Branagh and Elizabeth Debicki that really stand out. They were both fabulous, especially when they were bouncing off each other in their marital battle royale.

So, given this was my most anticipated movie of the year, it's a bit of a curate's egg for me. A mixture of being awe-struck at times and slightly disappointed at others. It's a movie which needs a second watch, so I'm heading back today to give my ear drums another bashing! And this is one where I reserve the right to revisit my rating after that second watch... it's not likely to go down... but it might go up.

Title: Brief, Non-Spoiler review
As this will be non-spoiler, I can't say too much about the story. However, what I can is this: Tenet's story is quite dynamic in the sense that you won't understand it till it wants you to. So, for the first half, your brain is fighting for hints and pieces to puzzle together the story. It isn't until halfway through the movie that Tenet invites you to the fantastic storytelling by Christopher Nolan.

Acting is beyond phenomenal, and I'd be genuinely surprised if neither Robert Pattinson nor John David Washington doesn't receive an Oscar nomination for best actor. It's also hard not to mention how good Elizabeth Debicki and Aaron Johnson both are. All around, great acting, and the dialogue amps up the quality of the movie.

The idea of this movie is damn fascinating, and while there are films that explore time-travelling, there's never been anything quite like this. It has such a beautiful charm and for the most part, explains everything thoroughly. It feels so much more complex than any form of time-travelling we've seen, and no less could've been expected from Nolan.

Oh my lord, the score for this film fits so perfectly. Every scene that's meant to feel intense was amped by a hundred because of how good the score was. Let me just say though, none of them will be found iconic, but they fit the story and scenes so well.

In the end, I walked out, feeling very satisfied. Nevertheless, I do have issues with the film that I cannot really express without spoiling bits of the story. There are definitely little inconsistencies that I found myself uncovering as the story progressed. However, I only had one issue that I found impacted my enjoyment. That issue was understanding some of the dialogue. No, not in the sense that the movie is too complicated, but more that it was hard to make out was being said at times. It felt like the movie required subtitles, but that probably was because, at a time in the film, there was far too much exposition.

Nevertheless, I loved this film, I'll be watching it at least two more times, and I think most of you in this group will enjoy it. I definitely suggest watching it in theatres if possible, just so you can get that excitement.

(4/5) & (8.5/10) for those that care about number scores.

Title: Brilliant Film
If you can, get to a cinema and watch Tenet.

If you can, watch it in IMAX.

If you can, watch it twice.

The film takes reality and plays it backwards and forwards at the same time. A mind bending, action packed experience like never seen in cinema before.

Title: An absolute masterpiece!
At first, I want to ask Christopher Nolan one question, HOW THE HELL YOU DID THIS? Seriously I want to have an answer, How did he write such as this masterpiece! How did he get this complicated, fabulous and creative idea? What is going on in his mind? The story is written and directed perfectly, the narration style was absolutely unique. I have no idea how can anyone direct such as this story, that was a huge challenge, and as usual Nolan gave us a masterpiece that we'll put beside (Memento), (Inception) and (Interstellar) The movie is so fast-paced in a good way, there was no boring moment. The chemistry between John David Washington and Robert Pattinson was great and funny and both of their performance was really good. Elizabeth Debicki performance was the best in the movie because she had the chance to show her acting abilities and she cached up that chance and showed us an A level acting.

The music wasn't unique and distinct as the music of Interstellar for example and I think this movie needed the touch of Hans Zimmer, I'm not saying that Ludwig Göransson failed but Hans Zimmer in another level.

If there was something I'd say that I didn't like it in the movie would it be that Nolan discarded any set up or characters backgrounds except Elizabeth Debicki dramatic story but it wasn't that bad for me, I didn't care about that, the exciting story didn't give me the chance to focus on it. But the actual problem was the third act, it was really complicated and I got lost and I convinced myself to discard the questions that were in my head and enjoy the well-made action sequences and Elizabeth Debicki performance.

I think this kind of movie that gets better with a second and third watch.

Title: Loud and impenetrable
A man on an international mission to save the world from the deadliest weapon of all, the future.

Two moods: excessive incomprehensible exposition and LOUD incomprehensible action sequences. At no point do you know what is going on, nor are you given any reason to care. It is at all times tedious, meaningless and irritating. None of the characters are remotely interesting, much of the dialogue is inaudible and the ridiculous convolutions add up to nothing. And this cost over $200 million to make.

Title: Tenet is built like a puzzle with a story that folds over itself enough times to make you believe the screenplay was built from origami.
It's been a long and bumpy road to release but the blockbuster event of the year is finally here. While lockdown may have warped people's perception of time, nothing can quite prepare you for the brain-addling time distortion on display in Christopher Nolan's latest feature Tenet.

From its heart racing opening to its dual-timeline finale, Nolan pushes the boundaries of how film is presented and meant to be consumed. Playing fast and loose with chronology, Tenet is built like a puzzle with a story that folds over itself enough times to make you believe the screenplay was built from origami. Put simply, the film demands numerous viewings to untangle its interwoven narrative and will undoubtably attract a myriad of interpretations.

Tenet also arrives at a time where cinemas are facing an uphill battle attracting audiences as they begin to reopen around the world. Luckily, Nolan has never been one to compromise the ambition of his films by doing things by half-measures. With its operatically staged action sequences and Ludwig Goransson's pulsating soundtrack, Tenet is a complete sensory overload that offers a cinematic experience not to be missed.

Title: Christopher Nolan does it again
One of Christopher Nolan's most fascinating movies yet . The inversion concept is unique & outstanding. The performances are excellent. The cinematography is super. Some scenes are simply breath taking. It's a visual art. The action and practical effects are incredible. It does require a lot of concentration and possibly multiple watches.

Title: Pseudo-intellectual mindless action/WASTE OF TIME (movie also speaks in CAPS LOCK!)
Big Nolan fan here. Doodlebug, Memento, The Prestige, Inception, Interstellar - all fresh and evocative stories. Needless to say, the bar was high going into Tenet.

I had already seen the first ten minutes some months earlier in a preview which had left me enticed for more pieces of a seemingly new Nolan-y brainiac puzzle.

Unfortunately, this movie feels like a self-parody.

It starts off well enough, and the backward visuals look interesting enough, but gradually everything starts to feel very gimmicky. The "message" isn't revealed until somewhere around the last fifteen minutes, and mostly as a sort of parenthesis or footnote, and by then I had sat through two hours wondering who the enemy was, what they wanted and why I should care (Sorry, but WW3 is way too abstract a term for me. How? Over what? Why? What is at stake?). The explanation felt cliché and exploitatively woke-y. In the film, the last lines were treated as a thought entirely unique and amazingly deep. Wtf? Did a high schooler write this?

The "inversion" part felt like an excuse to do cool visual stuff (which felt worn out very fast) instead of a basis for the exploration of a theme through story.

The score felt intrusive, loud (my friend had to cover their ears in the cinema) and painfully on the nose. I bet a lot of the dissonant music came from some "genius" idea of playing melody backwards. Sorry, ranting a bit now, I digress...

I watched my hope for a good story get crushed in non-stop action and chaos built around cardboard cut-out characters with no charm or personability. The actors seemed to be doing the best they could with what they had been given. The dialogue was, more often than not, laughable. Especially Debicki's character's lines were so cringe-y at times I could not believe what I was hearing.

Glamorous environments, expensive clothing, global jet setting and VIPs carrying the fate of the world in their hands. Is this an attempt at trying to launch an updated modern Bond franchise?

The film is competently made (cinematography, editing, production design etc), thus earning its five stars from me, but the story/execution is, I am sorry to say, sh**.

This isn't a brainiac puzzle so much as a director lost very far up his own a**. Even Kip Thorne did not want to be associated with this nonsense!

Contrived, chaotic, noisy, a director reveling in his own (convoluted) "smartness". Nolan, I have loved your stories in the past. Wth happened?

Title: Lots of potential, but chaotic and at tee end, unsatisfying
I am a big Nolan and Sci-Fi fan, and there's no question serious effort went into this movie. No question, the visuals were great, the acting was great, but the editing, PLOT and over-all effect was simply unsatisfying.

The plot is full of discontinuity and random plot elements, and the main time reversal issue is never adequately explained, resolved or identified, and even the cryptic "Tenet" keyword never seems to appear outside of the trailer cuts. The most annoying aspect was the often incomprehensible audio, due to masks and bad editing, that made many key moments a total mystery.

The plot is also littered with bad science of every possible kind, random statements that simply make no real sense (even using the odd time scenario) , and when viewed as ongoing story make you stop and say, how did we ever get HERE? The gun and bullet demonstration really sticks in my mind as total and complete cinematic plot garbage.

I don't doubt this could have been a masterful movie, but unlike Memento or Inception, the script and story continuity were simply not up to the complex story task. The one word that sticks in my mind about this movie is disappointing. After the long delay, i really expected something a lot better than this. Maybe a later edit will fix this, but it certainly doesn't need to get any longer.

Title: Confusing as hell but feels all right
It really confused me when I watched it yesterday. I can honestly say that I probably missed lots of details even though it came around in the end and settled nicely. I am sure that people who dive into the details will find these bits and pieces and time will help to digest the whole story. No matter you hate it or love it but you have to admit that the movies from Nolan are simply so innovative which the current movie industry simply cannot reproduce. He writes the story itself, he directs, chooses the actors, the locations and he mainly uses real world setups instead of computer generated ones. He is so creative and luckily does have the financial background to complete his plans. I think the main flaw of this movie that the viewer can feel unsatisfied at the end due to the complex setup and this brutal backwards mechanics.

Title: Nolan has officially out-Nolaned himself
I honestly don't quite know where to begin with Tenet. I love Christopher Nolan's work but I have never seen a more complicated film (and I understood Memento). After nearly three hours, I came away from Tenet not knowing myself, my mind reduced to nothing more than piles of ash.

Was there time travel involved? Hmm, there was definitely something about time inversion. I mean, does Nolan even understand what he wrote? Look, I give credit to the director because he's one of the few directors left who knows how to create a compelling and intelligent blockbuster. Tenet is full of Nolan trademarks - the gratuitous Michael Caine cameo, a loud, really loud score, complete with stunning cinematography and slickly inventive action set-pieces.

This time around however, Nolan has finally managed to 'out-Nolan' himself: the palindromic plot, whilst creatively ambitious, is simply far too complicated for its own good. Tenet is overlong, overstuffed, pretentious and too exhausting to comprehend in its entirety - it makes Inception and Interstellar look like Peppa Pig by comparison.

I'm aware of the technical wizardry and creative mastery in this film and lord knows I'll have to watch this again. For those who want a puzzle, Tenet at least provides a unique cinematic experience. But to actually enjoy solving it Nolan wants you to work very very hard.

Title: As a massive Nolan fan, this film is almost perplexing to the point where it's just plain ridiculous plotting.
Listen we all know Nolan swings for the fences of what's possible and pushes the realms of normality. This film for whatever reason just doesn't mesh together the way most of his films do even with complex suspension of disbelief aspects. It's often scattered and juxtaposed to a near outrageous level. The visuals are spectacular at times but also seem way too extravagant to take seriously other times. Robert Pattinson is flawless and probably the standout of the film with his vigorous performance. The same cannot be said about John David Washington's barren and emotionless lack of effort. I can't believe he was given the starring role. He brings the interest level down to almost unwatchable levels. Overall this is one of Nolan's rare misfires which he is capable of once in awhile.

Title: Two and a half hours of noise
Whilst I admired the cinematography, the backing soundtrack and music was too loud, sometimes louder than the dialogue. Two and a half hours seemed to go on and on with not much happening, a lot of repeating itself? Perhaps I am that average film goer and should stick to Eurovision. The six people in our screening stayed very quiet. I liked the Michael Caine cameo appearance.
